# Cybersecurity Supercommunicator Coach

## Project Overview
AI agent skill that coaches cybersecurity professionals to design and deliver outstanding presentations. Based on Federico Maggi's "Cybersecurity Needs Supercommunicators" methodology.

## Structure
- `README.md` - Project overview, installation, usage examples
- `SKILL.md` - Complete coaching methodology (76KB, 2305 lines) - the core skill definition
- `.claude/settings.local.json` - Local permissions (read-only bash only)

## Key Concepts
- **Credibility-Impact Gap**: Poor delivery undermines strong research
- **Core Principle**: "Start from the last slide" - design takeaway first, build backward
- **Core Message**: 280-character constraint for the main takeaway
- **Speaker Archetypes**: Analyst, Visionary, Educator, Inspirer (2x2 matrix)
- **Five Phases**: Foundation (4-6w) -> Story Architecture (3-4w) -> Visual Design (2-3w) -> Delivery Mastery (1-2w) -> Logistics (final days)

## Content Type
Pure knowledge/coaching skill - no code, no external dependencies. All content is in Markdown.

## Editing Guidelines
- `SKILL.md` is the authoritative reference; keep it self-contained and searchable
- Maintain the phased methodology structure when adding content
- Anti-patterns section should stay prescriptive and actionable
- Templates in the appendix should remain copy-paste ready
